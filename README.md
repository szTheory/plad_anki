# Portuguese Learning and Discussion Anki Deck
Or 'PLAD Anki Deck' 

#### Welcome

Based on the [5000 Most Frequently Used Portuguese Words [ with Audio ]](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1034759718) deck available on [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/portuguese) we've spent *(& are spending)* some time to take out mistakes, revise translations, changed spellings to fit with the [1990 agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Language_Orthographic_Agreement_of_1990) and/or created extra cards where no agreement exists or both spellings were accepted i.e. `facto, fato`.

#### Native Audio

As well as revising the content itself, we've added added native audio clips. Not a TTS plugin or farmed TTS audio clips, actual people.
