# Portuguese Learning and Discussion Anki Deck
Or 'PLAD Anki Deck' 

#### What can I do?
The aim of this deck is to provide audio for both European and Brazilian learners of Portuguese. To do this, we want our community to help us - help you. 

##### 1) Vote
Forvo has a 'standard-pronunication' concept which simply put - is whichever submission has the most votes, this typically mean the submission with 1 vote becomes the standard. This is a problem for us as for example - searching for the word `que` the first submission is actually `Ã©` and has 1 vote so has become the 'standard'. 
You can help by voting for audio which is
- Correct - *pretty important*
- Clear - *we're not audiophiles but the less background noise or static the better right?*

**NB**: You have to set your *native* language to Portuguese in order to vote. You only get to vote on 2 submissions - 1 Good vote and 1 Bad.  

##### 2) Submit
Native? Feel confident enough to submit something to a wider community? Then please consider pronouncing some words for Forvo, you don't need any software - they **provide** it for you on the website. 

And let us know! Mention it to us on discord (or PM @bean#2508) and let us celebrate your amazing enchanting tones *(even you fulano)*.

##### 3) We have a list!
We currently have a short list taken from our frequency list which has been checked and has no audio from a European Portuguese speaker. There's probably a Brazilian accent, if so **vote** if you don't have time to submit or there's a good submission already.
